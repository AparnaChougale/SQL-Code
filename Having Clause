/*
Having Clause
*/

	On EmployeeDemographics.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID
Group by JobTitle
Having COUNT(JobTitle) > 1


Select Jobtitle, Avg(Salary)
From EmployeeDemographics
Join EmployeeSalary
	On EmployeeDemographics.EmployeeID = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID
Group by JobTitle
Having Avg(Salary) > 45000
Order by Avg(Salary)


/*
Aggregate functions are not allowed because the WHERE clause is used for filtering data before aggregation. So while WHERE isn't for aggregation, it has other uses. 
To filter data based on an aggregate function result, you must use the HAVING clause
