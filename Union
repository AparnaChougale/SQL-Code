/*
Union, Union All

Union is simillar to Joins. The difference is, it combines two tables without spliting it different columns like join.
It should be used on same type of data and number of column. E.g. We have same data in 'EmployeeDemographics' and 'WareHouseEmployeeDemographics' table

Union removes duplicates, Union All shows all
